Solid Principles: 

Single Responsibility Principle:

I made a seperate 'Menu' class because the game class is already quite big and we want a class to do one thing well.
The Menu class displays a simple text menu, and makes sure the user enters correct input so we know what they want
to do before delivering their input back to the game class.

Open/Closed Principle:

For My 'Inventory' class I originally only had an array that stored integer values of the quantity of each item. 
I realized that this would be very frustrating if we wanted to change the items and that you couldn't add spoilage
(not yet implemented)in the future because you couldn't keep track of each individual product object. So I made a
list so that one can easily change the amount and type of products in your inventory.
